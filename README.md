# mcp_base
A simple library for parsing and packing fundamental types
for building network protocols. Licensed under the permissive ISC
license. See the LICENSE file for details. Comments and improvements
are welcome.

NOTE: The tests supplied in tests/ do not exhaustively test the contracts
of all of the functions, but they do check for many different errors.

## System Requirements
- C99 compiler
- stdlib: malloc, realloc, free, memmove, memcpy, strlen
- 8-bit char type
- Signed integers are represented using two's complement
- Floats are IEEE 754 32 bit floats in host endian
- Doubles are IEEE 754 64 bit floats in host endian

## Example Usage
Parsing a structure containing a varint and a short:
```c
struct mcp_parse buf = MCP_START_INITIALIZER(base, size);
mcp_varint_t a = mcp_varint(&buf);
uint16_t b = mcp_ushort(&buf);
if (!mcp_ok(&buf))
	/* There was an error! */
/* Otherwise, everything is fine. */
```

Packing the same struct back into a fbuf:
```c
struct fbuf buf = FBUF_INITIALIZER;
int ret = 0;
ret |= mcg_varint(buf, a);
ret |= mcg_ushort(buf, b);
if (ret)
    /* There was an error! */
/* Otherwise, everything is fine. */
```

Reading from a unix socket into a fbuf:
```c
void *ptr = fbuf_wptr(&buf, BLOCK_SIZE);
if (ptr == NULL)
    /* Error: Buffer full. */
ssize_t ret = read(fd, ptr, fbuf_wavail(&buf));
if (ret <= 0)
    /* Error: see man read (2) */
fbuf_produce(&buf, ret);
/* report that we have read ret bytes from fd */
```

Writing to a unix socket from a fbuf:
```c
if (fbuf_avail(&buf) == 0)
    /* Error: No data in buffer to write. */
ssize_t ret = write(fd, fbuf_ptr(&buf), fbuf_avail(&buf));
if (ret < 0)
    /* Error: see man write (2) */
fbuf_consume(&buf, ret);
/* report that we have written ret bytes to fd */
```

## API Documentation
### fbuf.h

###### `FBUF_MAX`
The default and maximum value of max_size; the absolute maximum size of a fbuf.

###### `FBUF_INITIALIZER`
Equivalent to calling `fbuf_init` with `FBUF_MAX`.

###### `void fbuf_init(struct fbuf *buf, size_t max)`
Sets up an `buf` for first use. Limiting the maximum size 
of the buffer to `max` bytes.
Only call this function once per fbuf object.

###### `void fbuf_clear(struct fbuf *buf);`
Clears any data waiting in the `buf`, but keeps the memory block.

###### `void fbuf_free(struct fbuf *buf);`
Resets `buf` as if it were just initialized with `fbuf_init`.
Frees any block of memory owned by fbuf. Does not free `buf`, i.e. does not call `free(buf)`.

###### `const unsigned char *fbuf_ptr(struct fbuf *buf);`
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the data waiting in the buffer.
Use `fbuf_avail` to get the size of the block of data returned.

The pointers returned by `fbuf_wptr` and `fbuf_ptr` are invalidated by all `fbuf_` calls to the same fbuf object except `fbuf_wptr` with a `require` argument of zero, `fbuf_wavail`, `fbuf_ptr`, and `fbuf_avail`.

###### `size_t fbuf_avail(struct fbuf *buf);`
Returns the size of data waiting in the fbuf.

###### `unsigned char *fbuf_wptr(struct fbuf *buf, size_t require);`
Returns a pointer to use when writing data into `buf`. 
Expands the buffer to guarantee that the pointer returned
will be at least `require` bytes long. If the memory allocation
failed, `fbuf_wptr` will return NULL.

The pointers returned by `fbuf_wptr` and `fbuf_ptr` are invalidated by all `fbuf_` calls to the same fbuf object except `fbuf_wptr` with a `require` argument of zero, `fbuf_wavail`, `fbuf_ptr`, and `fbuf_avail`.

###### `size_t fbuf_wavail(struct fbuf *buf);`
Returns the maximum size that wptr can satisfy without expanding
the `buf`.

###### `void fbuf_unproduce(struct fbuf *buf, size_t sz);`
Deletes `sz` bytes from the end of the buffer.

###### `void fbuf_produce(struct fbuf *buf, size_t sz);`
Commits `sz` bytes to the buffer that have been written to the
pointer returned by the most recent call to `fbuf_wptr`.

###### `void fbuf_consume(struct fbuf *buf, size_t sz);`
Removed `sz` bytes from `buf` starting from the pointer returned by
the most recent call to `fbuf_ptr`.

###### `size_t fbuf_expand(struct fbuf *buf, size_t requested_size);`
Resizes `buf` so it can hold at least `requested_size` more bytes in addition to the
data waiting in the buffer. `fbuf_expand` returns the the same value as `fbuf_wavail`

###### `void fbuf_compact(struct fbuf *buf);`
Rotates the buffer data so that the buffer starts at the data waiting in the buffer,
making future writes are more efficient. If you are doing
many repeated reads and writes, you should call this function to prevent the
buffer from much larger than the size of the data waiting in the buffer.

###### `int fbuf_shrink(struct fbuf *buf, size_t new_max);`
Changes the max size of the `buf` to new_max. Returns `0` if `fbuf_shrink`
succeeds without error, or `1` if new_max is too low and would truncate
data waiting in `buf`.

###### `int fbuf_copy(struct fbuf *dest, const void *src, size_t size);`
Copies `size` bytes from `src` into `dest`, expanding the buffer if necessary.
If the copy succeeds without error, `fbuf_copy` returns `0`.
Otherwise, it returns `1` on error.

| `float`     | `float`                           | `double`    | `double`                  |

###### `MCP_BYTES_MAX_SIZE`
The maximum accepted size of a bytes object. Useful for 
compatibility with implementations that use varint28 as
a length prefix.

###### `MCP_EOK`
No error, the parser will continue to parse data from the buffer.

###### `MCP_EOVERRUN`
An overrun occurred, there was not enough data in the buffer to
completely read the type requested.

###### `MCP_EOVERFLOW`
An overflow was encountered when trying to parse the data in the
buffer.

###### `MCP_EINVAL`
An invalid value was encountered when trying to parse the data
in the buffer.

NOTE: on error, the parser is left in an undefined state. You can copy
the parser to save it's state if you need to.

###### `int mcp_ok(struct mcp_parse *buf);`
Returns `1` if there are no errors asserted on `buf`. `0` otherwise.

###### `enum mcp_error_t mcp_error(struct mcp_parse *buf);`
Returns the error code asserted on `buf`.

###### `void mcp_start(struct mcp_parse *buf. const void *base, size_t size);`
Initializes the parser, `buf`, for use with `size` bytes starting at `base`.

###### `int mcp_eof(struct mcp_parse *buf);`
Returns `1` if the parser has reached the end of the buffer. `0` otherwise.

###### `size_t mcp_avail(struct mcp_parse *buf);`
Returns the number of bytes waiting to be processed in `buf`.

###### `size_t mcp_copy_*type*(type *dest, struct mcp_parse *buf, size_t max_size);`
If `dest`, which is `max_size` bytes long, is large enough to
hold the object in `buf`, then `mcp_copy_*type*` copies the
object into `dest` and consumes it from `buf` and returns
the size in bytes of the resultant object in dest, if applicable,
including the `NUL`-terminator. If `dest` is too small to hold the object
`MCP_EOVERFLOW` is not asserted, and is not copied to `dest` and the
object is not consumed from `buf`. If there was an error decoding
the object from `buf` the error is asserted on `buf` and zero is returned and
the parser is left in an undefined state.

NOTE: For an object to be consumed, the parser simply advances the pointer past the object.

###### `*type* mcp_*type*(struct mcp_parse *buf);`
Decodes and and consumes returns the decoded object from `buf`. If there was
an error in decoding the object, an error is asserted on `buf`
and a place-holder value is returned (typically zero) and the parser
is left an an undefined state.

WARNING: Pointers returned by this function with the types `raw` and `bytes`
are only valid as long as base is valid. mcp_copy_*type* does not have this
restriction, but is slightly less efficient due to a copy.

NOTE: For an object to be consumed, the parser simply advances the pointer past the object.

###### `int mcg_*type*(struct fbuf *buf, *type* value);`
Packs an `value` into `buf`, expanding `buf` if necessary.
Returns `0` if successful and `1` if there was an error.
On error, partial values may be written. If you need an
all-or-nothing call, store the old buffer size and uncommit
any partial writes.

An example implementation of this is:
```c
size_t old_avail = fbuf_avail(buf);
int ret = 0;
/* call generators */
ret |= mcg_varint_(buf, a);
ret |= mcg_ushort(buf, b);
/* ... */
if (ret) {
	/* rollback writes */
	fbuf_unproduce(old_avail - fbuf_avail(buf));
	/* handle error */
}
/* generator succeeded */
```
